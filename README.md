## 🌍 Project Description

This project implements a simple **Login and Registration system** using only **JavaScript** (without any back-end or server). It allows users to:

- Register new accounts with **name**, **email**, and **password**.
- Store user information locally using **localStorage**.
- Prevent duplicate registrations by ensuring email uniqueness.
- Log in with existing credentials and see a personalized **Profile Page**.
- Log out to clear session data.
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages.

## 🚀 Application Requirements

### 1. Registration Page  
- Input fields: **Name**, **Email**, and **Password**  
- User data stored in `localStorage`  
- Email must be unique (no duplicate registrations allowed)

### 2. Login Page  
- Input fields: **Email** and **Password**  
- Credentials validated against data stored in `localStorage`  
- Displays a welcome message upon successful login

### 3. Profile Page  
- Displays the logged-in user's name  
- Includes a **Logout** button that clears the session and returns to login

### 4. Error Handling  
- Shows alerts or messages for invalid login credentials  
- Prevents registration if email is already used

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
